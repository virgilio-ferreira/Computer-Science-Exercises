# PC Simulator

A project that will simulate the architecture we saw in class in a very simple way, it will have a main file for the execution of the program that will represent our Operating System and two classes that will represent Main and Secondary Memory.
Each type of memory will actually store the data in the memory it represents, with the Main storing everything in RAM and the secondary on disk through fs (File System) and through NodeJS we will be making calls to the Operating System to perform these tasks for us, as he will know how to use memories better than anyone else. The purpose of our script will be to perform the sum of an array of random numbers using the two memory implementations. Data will always be stored as strings!

to execute:
$ node operatingSystem.js

To see your pc resources:
$ node resources.js

To check your processId
$ node processId.js

or To check your memory use:
$ node memoryUse.js

ps: ctrl+c to stop.

Enjoy.
